About The Saga
The Shiva Trilogy, written by Amish Tripathi, has become a nation-wide bestseller in a short time. This is due to the refreshing new plot that it explores and the unique writing style of the author. The Secret of The Nagas is the second novel in the saga. Amish has penned down the contents of this book in such a way that it manages to shine as a stand-alone book in itself. The Plot and The Characterisations
In this book, Amish describes how Shiva sets forth on a quest to destroy the Naga clan in order to avenge the death of his brother; since the common belief he has been presented with is that the Nagas are the root of all evil. The author takes us through a virtual tour of India as Shiva travels different lands and gathers a vast number of generic and non-generic experiences, all in the quest of saving a plagued kingdom. As he travels, he garners more friends and family and leaves a mark. Slowly, events start unfolding in such a manner that whatever beliefs the readers and Shiva too held in the previous book are tarnished. Revelations occur as the evil-doers have been showcased in a new light and the grey shades of the positive protagonists in the earlier book are exposed. The book is filled with nuanced wisdom and Shiva leaves the readers with the message that good and evil are two sides of the same coin; which is why we shouldn't judge people. As suspense builds, the climax ends with Shiva finally entering he Naga territory making for a nail-biting finish.
